/*
Anycast in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) doesn't typically rely on a specific routing algorithm within the CDN itself. Instead, it leverages the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for routing decisions at the Internet's global routing level. BGP is a standardized exterior gateway protocol that is used to make core routing decisions on the Internet.

Here's a brief overview of how Anycast works in CDN with BGP:

BGP Routing:

The CDN provider configures routers to announce the same IP address from multiple locations.
BGP routers across the Internet maintain a table of IP address prefixes and the paths to reach them.
Nearest Exit Point:

When a user makes a request, it is directed to the nearest BGP router based on network conditions.
The BGP routers determine the shortest or most optimal path to reach the announced IP address.
Topological Proximity:

The BGP routers guide the request to the server that is topologically closest based on the network path.
Proximity might be determined by factors such as the number of network hops or lowest latency.
Dynamic Routing:

BGP is dynamic and adjusts to changes in network conditions. If a server or network path becomes unreachable or experiences issues,
BGP can reroute traffic to the next nearest available server.
In Anycast CDNs, the routing decisions are largely influenced by the global BGP routing infrastructure rather than an internal algorithm within the CDN.
This approach allows CDNs to take advantage of the inherent scalability and adaptability of BGP for directing traffic to the nearest server.

It's important to note that while BGP plays a crucial role in Anycast routing,
individual CDN providers may implement additional mechanisms or optimizations within their networks to enhance performance and reliability.
However, the specifics of these internal mechanisms can vary between CDN providers and are often proprietary.

    In the case of a Content Delivery Network (CDN), the CDN provider typically sets up Anycast by configuring routers to direct traffic to the nearest server with the same IP address.

In a more realistic scenario, using Java to demonstrate this network-level concept is not applicable. However, you can use Java to simulate the behavior of servers within a CDN.
Here's an example that uses the same IP address for servers:
